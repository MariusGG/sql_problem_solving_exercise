## Instructions
Create a process which solves parts A and B below; and then answer part C. Document your work using either a flowchart, pseudo-code, a written sequence of steps, or a programming language you are familiar with. The table below is example data, but your solution should be generic and hence applicable to any data supplied in this format.

	* Identify which pairs of rows have identical Products, Customers and Measures,
  and overlapping date ranges; e.g., as per rows 1 and 2.

	* Of the rows identified in part A, update the rows to make the date ranges not overlap.

	* Document any assumptions or decisions you needed to make for your solution.

## process

To identify which rows are identical, I have built this mark down structure below:


    |                   |       |                   | Widgets |                   |       |                   |
    |-------------------|-------|-------------------|---------|-------------------|-------|-------------------|
    |                   |       |                   |         |                   |       |                   |
    |                   | Tesco |                   |         |                   | Asada |                   |
    | Gross Sales Price |       | Distribution Cost |         | Gross Sales Price |       | Distribution Cost |

I looked at this structure as a one-to-many relationship where each node has only one parent but possibly multiple children.
This structure can then be used across many products and I am able to identify the overlapping dates easily.
The table its self looks like a relational database because of the uniq id for rows.
I was a bit thrown by the formate of the dates but after some google and looking through old projects.
I remembered the formats for dates in a database are displayed this way.
All products are Widgets, there are only two Customers (Tesco & Asada) and the means of Measure are ( Gross Sales Price & Distribution Cost ).
Within the table, I noticed in ROW 7 the "Valid From Day" & "Valid To Day" have long repeated digit which I believe suggests a NULL value.
I think the values were not given and a SQL command to amend that could be *ALTER TABLE exceedra
MODIFY Value int NOT NULL;* to make sure a value is entered in this column.

The structure above should allow me to then get a split set of data which have a hierarchical structure as:

  * *Product => Customer => Measure => Value => Valid From Day*


  Tesco - Gross Sales Price

  | Value | Valid From Day | Valid To Day |
  |-------|----------------|--------------|
  | 1     | 20130101       | 20130401     |
  | 1.5   | 20130301       | 20131231     |
  | 2     | 20130401       | 20150101     |

    Tesco - Distribution Cost

  | Value | Valid From Day | Valid To Day |
  |-------|----------------|--------------|
  | 5     | 20130101       | 20130401     |
  | 6     | 20130301       | 20140401     |
  | 7     | 20131231       | 20150101     |

  Asda - Gross Sales Price

  | Value | Valid From Day | Valid To Day |
  |-------|----------------|--------------|
  | 100   | 00000000       | 99999999     |
  | 200   | 20131231       | 20150101     |

  Asda - Distribution Cost

  | Value | Valid From Day | Valid To Day |
  |-------|----------------|--------------|
  | 2     | 20130301       | 20131231     |
  | 3     | 20140401       | 20150101     |


*( The dates aren't very clear and one of the dates are of NULL )*


## Solution

Having looked at the data from the table, I had noticed the overlapping date ranges for rows "1 & 2" and "5 & 6".
I wasn't sure how to best approach this and googled a few SQL queriers.

*( I have slightly changed the format to make it easier to read )*

Tesco - Gross Sales Price

| Value | Valid From Day | Valid To Day |
| :---: | :------------: | :----------: |
| 1     | 2013-01-01     | 2013-04-01   |
| 1.5   | 2013-03-01     | 2013-12-31   |

Tesco - Distribution Cost

| Value | Valid From Day | Valid To Day |
| :---: | :------------: | :----------: |
| 5     | 2013-01-01     | 2013-04-01   |
| 6     | 2013-03-01     | 2014-04-01   |

In order for me to find the overlapping dates, I would need to first query the database where if a rows Products, Customers and Measures are equal.
Then check if the dates overlap and store it into a new table or a temporary table, which I could probably use to update the original table.


```
- Get first row in table
- Select from table rows where product, customer and measure are the same
    â€¢ store these rows in groups
- go through all rows in their groups
- find the ones where dates overlap
```

It seems the first product starts on 2013-01-01 and the second product starts on the 2013-03-01. But unfortunately the first product runs over the second product and needs to probably last just a month.
So I need to find a way of changing the "Valid To Day" so it would be less than  the "Valid From Day" from the 2nd product.
It would seem as if the "Value" column has its role in how I can best approach this.
